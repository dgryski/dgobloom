This is a simple Bloom filter implementation written in  Go.

For the theory behind Bloom filters, read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter

This design uses a user-supplied hash function and salts provided at filter construction time.

To determine how many salts are required, call 'SaltsRequired' with the designed filter capacity
and false positive percentage.  bloom_test.go shows how to do this.
